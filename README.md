# IBM-Applied-AI-Professional-Certificate

## About this Professional Certificate

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming our world. Whether you’re a student, developer, or a technology consultant, understanding AI and knowing how to create AI powered applications can give you an edge in your career. This Professional Certificate is designed to arm you with the skills to work as an AI Application Developer.

It will give you a firm understanding of AI, its applications, and its use cases. You will become familiar with IBM Watson AI services and APIs. Even if you have no programming background, you will be able to create AI driven chatbots as well as pick up practical Python skills to work with AI. The courses will also enable you to apply pre-built AI smarts to your products and solutions. A learner with no prior knowledge of AI will learn to design, build, and deploy AI-powered applications on the web.

Rather than create complex AI algorithms and interfaces from scratch, learners will use IBM Watson AI services and APIs to create smart applications with minimal coding. By the end of this Professional Certificate, learners will complete several projects that showcase proficiency in applying AI and building AI powered solutions.

There are 6 Courses in this Professional Certificate

## COURSE 1:

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)


In this course you will learn what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, explore use cases and applications of AI, understand AI concepts and terms like machine learning, deep learning and neural networks. You will be exposed to various issues and concerns surrounding AI such as ethics and bias, & jobs, and get advice from experts about learning and starting a career in AI. You will also demonstrate AI in action with a mini project.

This course does not require any programming or computer science expertise and is designed to introduce the basics of AI to anyone whether you have a technical background or not.


## COURSE 2:

## Getting Started with AI using IBM Watson


In this course you will learn how to quickly and easily get started with Artificial Intelligence using IBM Watson. You will understand how Watson works, become familiar with its use cases and real life client examples, and be introduced to several of Watson AI services from IBM that enable anyone to easily apply AI and build smart apps. You will also work with several Watson services to demonstrate AI in action.

This course does not require any programming or computer science expertise and is designed for anyone whether you have a technical background or not.


## COURSE 3:

## Building AI Powered Chatbots Without Programming


This course will teach you how to create useful chatbots without the need to write any code.

Leveraging IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing capabilities, you'll learn how to plan, implement, test, and deploy chatbots that delight your users, rather than frustrate them. True to our promise of not requiring any code, you'll learn how to visually create chatbots with Watson Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation) and how to deploy them on your own website through a handy WordPress plugin. Don't have a website? No worries, one will be provided to you. Chatbots are a hot topic in our industry and are about to go big. New jobs requiring this specific skill are being added every day, consultants demand premium rates, and the interest in chatbots is quickly exploding. Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer interactions with the enterprise will be through automated means (that's chatbots and related technologies). Here is your chance to learn this highly in demand set of skills with a gentle introduction to the topic that leaves no stone unturned.


## COURSE 4:

## Python for Data Science and AI


This introduction to Python will kickstart your learning of Python for data science, as well as programming in general. This beginner-friendly Python course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours.

Module 1 - Python Basics o Your first program o Types o Expressions and Variables o String Operations 
Module 2 - Python Data Structures o Lists and Tuples o Sets o Dictionaries 
Module 3 - Python Programming Fundamentals o Conditions and Branching o Loops o Functions o Objects and Classes 
Module 4 - Working with Data in Python o Reading files with open o Writing files with open o Loading data with Pandas o Numpy Finally, you will create a project to test your skills.


## COURSE 5:

## Building AI Applications with Watson APIs


A learner will be able to write an application that leverages multiple Watson AI services (Discovery, Speech to Text, Assistant, and Text to Speech). By the end of the course, they’ll learn best practices of combining Watson services, and how they can build interactive information retrieval systems with Discovery + Assistant.

## COURSE 6:

## Introduction to Computer Vision with Watson and OpenCV


Computer Vision is one of the most exciting fields in Machine Learning and AI. It has applications in many industries such as self-driving cars, robotics, augmented reality, face detection in law enforcement agencies. In this beginner-friendly course you will understand about computer vision, and will learn about its various applications across many industries.

As part of this course you will utilize Python, Watson AI, and OpenCV to process images and interact with image classification models. You will also build, train, and test your own custom image classifiers. This is a hands-on course and involves several labs and exercises. All the labs will be performed on the Cloud and you will be provided access to a Cloud environment completely free of charge. At the end of the course, you will create your own computer vision web app and deploy it to the Cloud. This course does not require any prior Machine Learning or Computer Vision experience, however some knowledge of Python programming language is necessary.
